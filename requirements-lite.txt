# =============================================================================
# LIGHTWEIGHT REQUIREMENTS - Same as requirements.txt
# =============================================================================
# NOTE: This file is now identical to requirements.txt
#
# The layoutparser dependency has been removed due to paddlepaddle conflicts,
# so requirements.txt is already lightweight (~200MB download).
#
# Use either requirements.txt or requirements-lite.txt - they're the same!
# =============================================================================

# Core document parsing with PDF support
# This alone can handle excellent table extraction
unstructured[pdf]>=0.11.0,<0.12.0

# PDF processing dependencies
pdf2image
pdfminer.six
pytesseract
pillow
python-magic

# Data processing
pandas
numpy

# Utilities
python-dotenv

# =============================================================================
# What changed:
# - Removed layoutparser (dependency conflicts with paddlepaddle)
# - Removed PyTorch (was only needed for layoutparser)
# - Result: Fast installation, no dependency conflicts
# - Table extraction still works great with 'auto' and 'fast' strategies
