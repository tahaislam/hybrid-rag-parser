# LIGHTWEIGHT REQUIREMENTS - Basic PDF Parsing Without Advanced Table Detection
# =============================================================================
# Use this file if you're having issues with layoutparser or PyTorch
# This provides basic table extraction without computer vision models
#
# Installation:
#   pip install --upgrade pip
#   pip install -r requirements-lite.txt
#
# Note: This uses the "fast" strategy instead of "hi_res"
# Tables will still be extracted, just without advanced CV-based detection
# =============================================================================

# Core document parsing with PDF support
# This alone can handle basic table extraction
unstructured[pdf]>=0.11.0,<0.12.0

# PDF processing dependencies
pdf2image
pdfminer.six
pytesseract
pillow
python-magic

# Data processing
pandas
numpy

# Utilities
python-dotenv

# =============================================================================
# What's NOT included (compared to full requirements.txt):
# - layoutparser (heavy, needs specific version)
# - paddledetection (very heavy, complex to install)
# - torch/torchvision (~1GB download, requires specific setup)
#
# When to use this:
# - Quick start / testing
# - Installation issues with full requirements
# - Don't need highest-accuracy table detection
# - Limited disk space or bandwidth
#
# When to use full requirements.txt:
# - Need best table detection accuracy (hi_res strategy)
# - Working with complex documents with nested tables
# - Production deployment where accuracy is critical
